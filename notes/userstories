A: Word shortener/lengthener

As a user, I want to be able to enter one long word (10+ characters) and receive a shorter synonym
As a user, I want to be able to enter one short word and receive a longer synonym

As a user, if I enter a paragraph, I should be given a choice about:
    1) whether to shorten or lengthen words
    2) whether words will be replaced
        a) randomly
            If I choose random: I should receive my original paragraph, with random longer or shorter synonyms replacing all short/long words
        b) at my discretion
            If I decide to choose each word individually, I should receive a list of synonyms and have the option to enter my chosen synonym into my paragraph, or to leave the original word.
    3) if lengthening, whether or not to ignore function words (only changing content words)

B: Essay info/mixer

As a user, I want to be able to enter a text and:
    - get information on the most commonly used content words
    - get a text in which every content word is replaced with its definition
    - get a text in which every content word is replaced with a word in the same category
    - get a text in which every content word is replaced with a word in the same part of speech (aka mad libs)
    - get a text in which every word is replaced with a homophone, if one exists
    - get a text in which every word rhymes in 1-to-1 correspondence with my words
