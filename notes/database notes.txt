    words_array.each do |word|
        PART 1(word)
        PART 2(word)



PART 1. call ?sl; the first word object will be bad - get info on "bad" and add it to :shortwords
    query(?sl, word)[0] to get word object with attributes
    Is word long or short?
    Create either LongWord or ShortWord with following attributes:
        - word
        - length(part of word itself)
        - part of speech
        - # syllables
        - definition

    query_types.each do |type|
        query(type, word) to get an ARRAY of related word objects with attributes
        Is word long or short?

    For each new word, use the info to add to either :shortwords or :longwords
        Create either LongWord or ShortWord with following attributes:
            - word
            - length(part of word itself)
            - part of speech
            - # syllables

    If ORIGINAL WORD ("bad") is short and new word is long, also create a WordLink joining the two.

            - ShortWord
            - LongWord
