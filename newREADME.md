# Essay Editor

Welcome to the essay editor. This project was created to lengthen or shorten essays for individuals facing a page minimum or maximum.

# Motivation

This project was created to demonstrate our understanding of Sqlite3 databases and the use of APIs in a CLI. We wanted to make a CLI that was useful in everyday life, and remembered our college days when we stressed about meeting a page limit whilst writing an essay. We wanted to make it easier for students to see all the words avaiable to be changed. That way, the student could edit their essay with relative ease and efficiency.
